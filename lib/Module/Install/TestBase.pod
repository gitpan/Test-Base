=head1 NAME

Module::Install::TestBase - Module::Install Support for Test::Base

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use inc::Module::Install;

    name            'Foo';
    all_from        'lib/Foo.pm';

    use_test_base;

    WriteAll;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds the C<use_test_base> directive to Module::Install.

Now you can get full Test-Base support for you module with no external
dependency on Test::Base.

Just add this line to your Makefile.PL:

    use_test_base;

That's it. Really. Now Test::Base is bundled into your module, so that it is
no longer any burden on the person installing your module.
